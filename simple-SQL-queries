--Retrieve everything from a table

SELECT * FROM facilities;


--Retrieve specific columns from a table

SELECT name, membercost FROM facilities;


--Control which rows are retrieved

SELECT * FROM facilities
WHERE membercost > 0;


--Control which rows are retrieved - part 2

SELECT facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance
FROM facilities
WHERE membercost > 0
AND membercost < (monthlymaintenance/50);


--Basic string searches

SELECT * FROM facilities 
WHERE name LIKE '%Tennis%';


--Matching against multiple possible values

SELECT * FROM facilities
WHERE facid IN (1,5);


--Classify results into buckets

SELECT name , CASE
WHEN monthlymaintenance > 100 THEN 'expensive'
WHEN monthlymaintenance <= 100 THEN 'cheap'
END "cost"
FROM facilities;


--Working with dates

SELECT memid, surname, firstname, joindate
FROM members
WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';


--Removing duplicates, and ordering results

SELECT DISTINCT surname
FROM members
ORDER BY surname
LIMIT 10;


--Combining results from multiple queries

SELECT surname FROM members
UNION
SELECT name FROM facilities;


--Simple aggregation

SELECT joindate AS latest
FROM members 
ORDER BY joindate DESC 
LIMIT 1;

/* Also possible to 'use max(joindate) as latest'*/


--More aggregation

SELECT firstname, surname, joindate
FROM members 
WHERE joindate = (SELECT max(joindate) FROM members);

/*ORDER BY & LIMIT are held back by the unlikely possibility of 2 people joining at the exact same time*/
